/* Containers in C++ STL | C++ Tutorials for Beginners #70
In the last tutorial, we had briefed about the three components of STL, namely,
Containers, objects which store data, Algorithms, set of procedures to process data, and Iterators,
  objects which point to some element in a container.

Today, in this tutorial, we will be interested in discussing more about containers.

Containers are themselves of three types: 
    Sequence Containers
    Associative Containers
    Derived Containers

When we talked about containers, we said containers are objects which store data, but what are its three types all about?
We’ll discuss that too.

Sequence Containers:
    A sequence container stores that data in a linear fashion.
    Refer to the illustration below to understand what storing something in a linear fashion means.
    Sequence containers include Vector, List, Dequeue etc. These are some of the most used sequence containers.

Associative Containers:
    An associative container is designed in such a way that enhances the accessing of some element in that container.
    It is very much used when the user wants to fastly reach some element.
    Some of these containers are, Set, Multiset, Map, Multimap etc.
    They store their data in a tree-like structure.

Derived Containers:
    As the name suggests, these containers are derived from either the sequence or the associative containers.
    They often provide you with some better methods to deal with your data. They deal with real life modelling.
    Some examples of derived containers are Stack, Queue, Priority Queue, etc.
    The following illustration give you the idea of how a stack works.

Now since we have got the basic idea of all the three types of containers, a question which might arise is when to use which.
So, let’s deal with that,

In sequence containers, we have Vectors, which has following properties:
    Faster random access to elements in comparison to array.
    Slower insertion and deletion at some random position, except at the end.
    Faster insertion at the end.

In Lists, we have,
    Random accessing elements is too slow, because every element is traversed using pointers.
    Insertion and deletion at any position is relatively faster, because they only use pointers, which can easily be manipulated.
    In associative containers, every operation except random access is faster in comparison to any other containers,
      be it inserting or deleting any element.

In associative containers,
    We cannot specifically tell which operation is faster or slower.
    We’ll have to inspect every data structure separately. */
